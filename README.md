This project is a four-page website concept derived from the Frontend Mentor challenge. It is constructed in React with the SASS pre-processor. 

## My Notes

As this project has minimal Javascript functionality, I will let the design speak for itself. As with my other multi-page projects, the routing is handled via react-router. Each of the pages has multiple views depending on the user's screen size, and the "story" cards have transition states for a better user experience. I think that the code in this project is fairly clean, though there are some spots that I would like to optimize a bit more. This is my first time using pseudo-elements (::before) in this manner, which I used in a couple places for additional styling without needing to make the code needlessly complicated. This is also my first time using a table for stylistic purposes, and I think that it turned out well. The whole project only took me a few days total, and I think that its a solid display of my abilities of being able to turn a design into a full-fledged website.
